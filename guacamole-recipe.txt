Credits to Martin O. and Chris W. for inspirations.

==============
Ingredients:
==============

4.0 Soft/ ripe avocados
0.5 Onions
3.0 Tomatoes
2.0 Limes
4.0 Jalapenos
4.0 Serano Peppers
0.5 Cilantro Head
Garlic Salt

==========
Process:
==========

1. Half the avocados and remove seed.  Score the avocado still in the skin and then remove (avocado will be in little cubes).
2. Place all avocado in a metal bowl and mash with potato masher or whatever you have that smooshes avocadoes well.
3. Dice up onion to whatever fineness you like and add to bowl.
4. Dice tomatoes and strain excess juice, add to bowl.
5. Squeeze lime juice into bowl.  I find cutting lime into 4's makes this easiest if you don't have a press.
6. Add garlic salt and season to your liking.  
7. Chop and add as much cilantro as you like.  I like it so I use half to a whole Safeway size bundle of cilantro.
8. Cut in half and remove seeds from jalapenos and serano peppers.
9. Chop up and add as much jalapeno and serano as you like.  I usually do 1 jalpeno and 1 serano per avocado.
	If you like it spicier consider a finely diced habanero pepper as well.
10. Stir everything in your bowl and add more of anything you need until it tastes right.
